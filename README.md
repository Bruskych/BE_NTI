### Tech Stack & Tools
* **Core:** Laravel 13 & PHP 8.4
* **Database & Caching:** MySQL 8, Redis
* **Dev Environment:** Docker Compose, Mailpit (SMTP Testing)
* **Auth & Security:** Secure token authentication via Laravel Sanctum and middleware-enforced RBAC using Spatie.
* **Documentation:** OpenAPI / Swagger (L5-Swagger)

---

### 📥 1. Quick Start

```Clones the repository``` with the backend code from GitHub to your local computer.
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

You need to go inside the ```project folder```
```bash
cd BE_NTI
```

Creates a copy ````(.env)```` of the template file .env.example
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

---

### 🐳 2. Start Containers

Since Composer dependencies are baked into the Dockerfile, the initial build might take a few minutes. Run the following command to build and start all microservices in the background:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

---

### 🔐 3. Generate Application Key

Once the containers are running, generate a unique encryption key for your Laravel application. This key is used to securely encrypt user sessions, cookies, and tokens. Without it, the app will throw a 500 error.

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```
```OR```
```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate
```

---

### 📄 4. Run Migrations and Seeders

Set up the database structure and populate it with initial data, roles, and administrative accounts:

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate --seed
```

---

### ⚙️ Service Architecture & Ports

All services running inside the Docker network are pre-configured. You can access them via the following local URLs:

| Service | 🌐 Context / UI URL                     | Internal Port | External Port |
|---|-----------------------------------------|---|---|
| API Endpoint | http://localhost:8000/api               | — | 8000 |
| Swagger UI | http://localhost:8000/api/documentation | — | 8000 |
| phpMyAdmin | http://localhost:8080                   | 80 | 8080 |
| Mailpit (Email Hub) | http://localhost:8025                   | 8025 | 8025 |

### ⚙️ Background Processing & Automation

Thanks to the dedicated infrastructure containers, you don't need to configure host crontabs or run manual processing commands.

* **Asynchronous Queues (`nti-queue`):** Processes emails, notifications, and heavy background tasks automatically.
* **Task Scheduler (`nti-scheduler`):** Automatically runs Laravel's internal loop (`schedule:work`) every minute to trigger deadline reminders and maintenance tasks.

To manually trigger the deadline reminders immediately for debugging, run:

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan notifications:deadline-reminders --days=3
```

---

### 🧪 Running Tests

Execute the comprehensive test suite (Unit, Integration, and Security test coverage for XSS, SQL injection, and rate limiting) directly inside the containerized environment:

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan test
```

---

## 📦 API Documentation (Swagger)

Swagger UI is available at http://localhost:8000/api/documentation after starting the server.

If you modify annotations in Controllers or DTOs, regenerate the OpenAPI specification file using the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan l5-swagger:generate
```
